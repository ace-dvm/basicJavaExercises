/**
 * Write classes which fill the following requirements:
 * - create a correct 52-card deck of cards
 * - pull two random cards out of the deck and compare them to 
 *   determine which is better (remember to cover the case when 
 *   they are equal). Make sure that it is not possible to pull 
 *   two identical cards from the deck.
 *   Write a test which will check that your code correctly ranks
 *   two cards. This would be a difficult test to write 
 *   with your 52-card deck. How can you make it simpler? Which pairs
 *   of cards are important to test, to be reasonably confident that
 *   it will handle all pairs correctly?
 * 
 * - shuffle the deck
 * - pull a random card out of the deck
 * - determine the position of the next card in the deck which will beat this card
 *   If you can, write a test for this function, too.
