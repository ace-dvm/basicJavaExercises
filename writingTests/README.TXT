PROJECT TITLE: writingTests
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: practice writing tests
VERSION or DATE: Oct 2010
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Follow the instructions in each file
AUTHORS: Ace Medlock
USER INSTRUCTIONS:
SimplestTest: Write a test to determine whether the method "giveFour" in SimpleNumber returns 4, then write the method giveFour().
  Uses: SimpleNumber
TestRanges: Ranges says whether a number represents the low, normal, or high range for a value. Ideally, it would give a correct answer for any number from negative to positive infinity. What is an efficient way to test it? Is there any ambiguity which needs to be resolved? Is there a (potential) error in Ranges?
  Uses: Ranges
TestHiLo: Confirm that HiLo returns a high value or a low value when asked for one.
  Uses:HiLo
SplitsTest: Write a test to determine whether the convolution() method behaves as described. Why is this more difficult than it should be? Is there a better way to write an equivalent class to Splits which accomplishes the same task, but is easier to test?
  Uses: Splits
CardTest: Write classes and tests which fulfill the functions described.
