The classes in these folders illustrate two different ways for classes with shared behavior to be created: 
inheritance and composition. Consider the two implementations of Wonderland. 
Which one is easier to understand?
In which would it be easier to create a CheshireOwl (a new type of CheshireThing)? 
In which would it be easier to create a CheshireSiamese (a type of CheshireCat that implements one additional method)?
In which would it be easier to express the property "Mad", shared by the MarchHare and MadHatter, which gives
  them a different set of possible responses while playing chess?
After you've added the "Mad" functionality, in which would it be easier to create a CheshireMarchHare, which is 
  both Cheshire and Mad?
